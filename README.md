# project
easy ATM
It is simple ATM app. One of my first projects on JAVA to understand the use of Interfaces. We have interface BankAccount. CityBankAccount and NationalBankAccount implements the interface BankAccount. Since our ATM is CityBank's ATM we can get money without comissions with CityBankAccount, while 200 tg will be taken with NationalBankAccount.
